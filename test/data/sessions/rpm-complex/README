Session:
1) yum install httpd (which had previously not been installed and 
   caused a number of other packages to be pulled in)
2) vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf

Test using this session should demonstrate that we can
a) avoid reporting config files installed by the rpm as changed when they
   are still identical to the rpm provided ones
b) reduce the set of installed rpm's to the leaf ones
