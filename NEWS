0.3.0 2007-05-07
  - Remove lots of unneeded attributes from generated manifest
  - Previously finished sessions can now be resumed 
    (with `cft begin -r SESSION')
  - Prune RPM package set to only leaf packages; packages that were 
    updated/installed and depend on other packages that were 
    updated/installed during the session are not included in the manifest

0.2.0 2007-03-21
  - Understand package operations (install/update/erase) Be smart about
    files put down by the rpm, but otherwise unchanged
  - Add 'pack' command to make moving raw sessions around easier
  - Require puppet > 0.22.1 (puppet changed some internal API's, 
    aka "the state -> property rename")

0.1.0 2007-01-12
  - First release, ever
  - Support most simple puppet types, except for cron, sshkey, and package
  - Produces manifest and/or tarball (bundle) of changes
