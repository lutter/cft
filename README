This tool (cft, pronounced 'sift') tries to follow a sysadmin as she makes
changes to the system. For now, there is no analysis of what's recorded,
though that's somewhat desirable.

Changes are grouped into 'sessions' to let the admin indicate that they are
fixing the mailserver, the webserver etc. Basic flow is

tux# cft -w SESSION
tux# cft -o SESSION /etc/mail
tux# vi ...
tux# cft -k SESSION
tux# ls -l /tmp/cft/SESSION

In full words:

* Admin starts a session with 'cft -w SESSION', which essentially sets up
  gamin to watch a number of predefined directories (CFG_WATCH_DIRS in
  bin/cft, currently /var/run, /var/lock/subsys, and /etc) cft stores its
  output in /tmp/cft/SESSION
* Admin then squirrels away original files they find important with 
  'cft -o SESSION DIR|FILE...' (This can be done repeatedly and at any point,
  though you have to be careful not to clobber originals after making changes)
* Admin makes changes exactly the way they would without cft
* Stop session with 'cft -k SESSION'
* Admire results in /tmp/cft/SESSION
