* Watch the rpm db
* Use rsync instead of homegrown tree-copying code ?
* Integrate with an SCM ?
* If you keep a session running for a while you get false change info
  from various daemons scribbling all over the place (e.g. /etc/printcap
  and /etc/mtab)
* Analyse the output
  - Reconstruct events from certain things (e.g. service start/stop/restart
    from how files appear and disappear in /var/run)
  - Find packages that were installed from txn timestamps in rpm DB (and
    clean the bare log from changes that are due to package installs)
