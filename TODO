* Watch the rpm db

* Use rsync instead of homegrown tree-copying code ?

* Integrate with an SCM ?

* If you keep a session running for a while you get false change info
  from various daemons scribbling all over the place (e.g. /etc/printcap
  and /etc/mtab)

* Analyse the output
  - Reconstruct events from certain things (e.g. service start/stop/restart
    from how files appear and disappear in /var/run)
  - Find packages that were installed from txn timestamps in rpm DB (and
    clean the bare log from changes that are due to package installs)

* The synchronzation between the demon and the cmdline prog in Session is
  full of races. Instead of whacky gamin stuff, we should use pipes or
  similar. The essential issue though is that there is no telling how long
  after gamin gets a request it will actually report events on them.

* Replace gamin with somethign else

  Gamin causes weird races since there's no telling when it starts to
  actually monitor a dir. All we really need is some mechanism to tell us
  which files have been modified during the session; the nice thing about
  gamin is that we don't have to stat a huge amount of files, though that
  might turn out to be more robust than Gamin is.
