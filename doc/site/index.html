<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Cft (pronounced <em>sift</em>) watches a system administrator as she
makes changes to a system. Its basic principle is heavily influenced by
Gnome's <a
href="http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog/sabayon">Sabayon</a>. Instead of the
desktop though, cft is focused on traditional system administrators and how
they maintain machines, mostly with command line tools.</p>

<p>Cft uses <a href="http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet">puppet</a>
as its backbone for expressing the configuration of a system, and for
understanding in greater detail what changes the admin has made to the
system. Sites that already use <tt>puppet</tt> to manage their
configuration can easily integrate <tt>cft</tt>'s output into the overall
site configuration; for sites that use some other means of configuration
management, <tt>cft</tt>'s output provides a complete record of changes
made and serves as a good starting point of integrating the changes back
into the site's configuration.
</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>In lieu of colorful screenshots, a simple example will explain in more
detail how <tt>cft</tt> works: <tt>cft</tt> organizes changes in
<em>sessions</em> to let the user better indicate what aspect of the system
they are fixing (the webserver, the mailserver etc.) A simple session to
fix the configuration of postfix and to start and enable the service might
entail root running the following commands:
</p>

<pre>
  tux:1# cft begin postfix
  tux:2# yum -y install postfix
  tux:3# vi /etc/postfix/main.cf
  tux:4# chkconfig postfix on
  tux:5# service postfix start
  tux:6# cft finish postfix
</pre>

<p>Note that the user only had to issue two additonal commands to begin and
finish the session, everything else in the session is <em>exactly</em> the
same as if the changes had been made without <tt>cft</tt>. The command
<tt>cft begin postfix</tt> tells <tt>cft</tt> to start a session called
<tt>postfix</tt>, and the last command <tt>cft finish postfix</tt> tells it
to do the final bookkeeping necessary for analysing the results</p>

<p>Once the commands above have been issued, running <tt>cft manifest
postfix</tt> will print the changes in the form of a <tt>puppet</tt>
manifest:</p>
<pre>
  tux:6# cft manifest postfix
    class postfix {
        package { 'postfix.i386':
          ensure => '2:2.3.3-2'
        }

        service { 'postfix':
            enable => 'true',
            pattern => 'postfix',
            ensure => 'running'
        }

        file { '/etc/aliases.db':
            group => 'smmsp',
            owner => 'root',
            mode => '0640',
            source => '/tmp/cft/postfix/after/etc/aliases.db'
        }

        file { '/etc/postfix/main.cf':
            group => 'root',
            owner => 'root',
            mode => '0644',
            source => '/tmp/cft/postfix/after/etc/postfix/main.cf'
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>This manifest tells puppet that puppet should enable and start the
<tt>postfix</tt> service, and that the two files should be copied from the
location mentioned as the <tt>source</tt> and receive the given owner,
group, and mode. <tt>cft</tt> takes care of copying all modified files into
a safe location so that they can be copied off the machine into a central
location. The mention of the file <tt>aliases.db</tt> is somewhat spurious:
it gets automatically recreated by the init script for <tt>postfix</tt>,
and <tt>cft</tt> treats it exactly as if the user had created the file.</p>

<p>To facilitate moving the changes onto a central serevr, <tt>cft</tt> can
also convert a session into a tarball that contains both the
<tt>puppet</tt> manifest and all the files that are mentioned in it, in
this case <tt>aliases.db</tt> and <tt>main.cf</tt>. Fancier, more
convenient methods of integrating changes back into a central
<tt>puppet</tt> server are planned for the future.

<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p><b>Cft 0.2.1</b><br/>
Previously finished sessions can now be resumed  (with `cft begin -r SESSION')<br/>
Remove lots of unneeded attributes from generated manifest<br/>
Prune RPM package set to only leaf packages; packages that were
updated/installed and depend on other packages that were updated/installed
during the session are not included in the manifest

<p><b>Cft 0.2.0</b><br/>
This release understands package operations, so that running
<tt>yum&nbsp;-y&nbsp;install&nbsp;httpd</tt> (or <tt>rpm -Uvh
foo.i386.rpm</tt>) will produce appropriate <tt>package</tt> statements in
the resulting manifest.<br/>

You will need the <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-rpm/">ruby-rpm</a>
bindings.

<p><b>Cft 0.1.0</b><br/>
The very first release of Cft. Understands most of puppet's builtin types
&mdash; only cron, sshkey, and package are missing.<br/>
If you use the RPM, you might
also need <tt>ruby-fam</tt> (the ruby <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~veillard/gamin/">gamin</a> bindings) from Fedora, or build it
yourself from <a href="http://pablotron.org/software/fam-ruby/">upstream</a>.

<A NAME="FAQ"></A>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p>
<B>What can Cft do for me?</B><br/>
Cft watches you as you make configuration changes to your system and
remembers those changes. When you are done with making the changes, Cft
digests and summarizes them in a format suitable for feeding them to <a href="http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet">Puppet</a>
</p>

<p>
<B>Who is the intended audience?</B><br/> Anyone who makes changes to a
system as root, especially system administrators at small and large
sites. Cft will be particularly useful to you if you use <a
href="http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet">Puppet</a> to manage the
configuration of your machines.
</p>

<p>
<B>How is Cft used?</B><br/> Cft is used from the command line, just before
you begin making configuration changes, and right after you finished making
them. It only requires you to issue two additonal commands, there's no need
to learn any other special tools or avoid using your favorite tool. (Well,
if that's <tt>vi</tt> there's a special restriction in the license to keep
you from using it) (I KEED, I KEED, you can use <tt>vi</tt> though it's bad
for the character)
</p>

<p>
<b>Does Cft only work for Red Hat based Linux distributions?</b><br/>
Honestly, I don't know; I would be very interested in making sure that Cft
works on all the Linux distributions and OS's that Puppet works on, though
I will have to rely on help from others for most of the work there. If you
are using (or trying to use) Cft on one of those OS's, drop me a line.
</p>

<!--
<p>
<B>How do I install cft?</B><br/>
The easiest way is to enable the appropriate branch of <a
href="http://people.redhat.com/dlutter/yum">my yum repo</a> on a machine
and installing from there. The repo should always have proper packages of
cft and its dependencies, as long as they are not part ofhte base
distribution.

<h2>Convenience.</h2>
<p>
Cft saves you from having to remember what exactly you changed on a
system&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;it watches you and remembers for&nbsp;you, leaving
you free to focus on the result you need to achieve.</p>
