<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Cft (pronounced <em>sift</em>) watches a system administrator as she
makes changes to a system. Its basic principle is heavily influenced by
Gnome's <a
href="http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog/sabayon">Sabayon</a>. Instead of the
desktop though, cft is focused on traditional system administrators and how
they maintain machines, mostly with command line tools.</p>

<p>Cft uses <a href="http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet">puppet</a>
as its backbone for expressing the configuration of a system, and for
understanding in greater detail what changes the admin has made to the
system. Sites that already use <tt>puppet</tt> to manage their
configuration can easily integrate <tt>cft</tt>'s output into the overall
site configuration; for sites that use some other means of configuration
management, <tt>cft</tt>'s output provides a complete record of changes
made and serves as a good starting point of integrating the changes back
into the site's configuration.
</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>In lieu of colorful screenshots, a simple example will explain in more
detail how <tt>cft</tt> works: <tt>cft</tt> organizes changes in
<em>sessions</em> to let the user better indicate what aspect of the system
they are fixing (the webserver, the mailserver etc.) A simple session to
fix the configuration of postfix and to start and enable the service might
entail root running the following commands:
</p>

<pre>
  tux:1# cft begin postfix
  tux:2# vi /etc/postfix/main.cf
  tux:3# chkconfig postfix on
  tux:4# service postfix start
  tux:5# cft finish postfix
</pre>

<p>Note that the user only had to issue two additonal commands to begin and
finish the session, everything else in the session is <em>exactly</em> the
same as if the changes had been made without <tt>cft</tt>. The command
<tt>cft begin postfix</tt> tells <tt>cft</tt> to start a session called
<tt>postfix</tt>, and the last command <tt>cft finish postfix</tt> tells it
to do the final bookkeeping necessary for analysing the results</p>

<p>Once the commands above have been issued, running <tt>cft manifest
postfix</tt> will print the changes in the form of a <tt>puppet</tt>
manifest:</p>
<pre>
  tux:6# cft manifest postfix
    class postfix {
        service { "postfix":
            enable => "true",
            pattern => "postfix",
            ensure => "running"
        }
    
        file { "/etc/aliases.db":
            group => "smmsp",
            owner => "root",
            mode => "0640",
            source => "/tmp/cft/postfix/after/etc/aliases.db"
        }
    
        file { "/etc/postfix/main.cf":
            group => "root",
            owner => "root",
            mode => "0644",
            source => "/tmp/cft/postfix/after/etc/postfix/main.cf"
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>This manifest tells puppet that puppet should enable and start the
<tt>postfix</tt> service, and that the two files should be copied from the
location mentioned as the <tt>source</tt> and receive the given owner,
group, and mode. <tt>cft</tt> takes care of copying all modified files into
a safe location so that they can be copied off the machine into a central
location. The mention of the file <tt>aliases.db</tt> is somewhat spurious:
it gets automatically recreated by the init script for <tt>postfix</tt>,
and <tt>cft</tt> treats it exactly as if the user had created the file.</p>

<p>To facilitate moving the changes onto a central serevr, <tt>cft</tt> can
also convert a session into a tarball that contains both the
<tt>puppet</tt> manifest and all the files that are mentioned in it, in
this case <tt>aliases.db</tt> and <tt>main.cf</tt>. Fancier, more
convenient methods of integrating changes back into a central
<tt>puppet</tt> server are planned for the future.

<A NAME="FAQ"></A>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p>
<B>What can Cft do for me?</B><br/>
Cft watches you as you make configuration changes to your system and
remembers those changes. When you are done with making the changes, Cft
digests and summarizes them in a format suitable for feeding them to <a href="http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet">Puppet</a>
</p>

<p>
<B>Who is the intended audience?</B><br/> Anyone who makes changes to a
system as root, especially system administrators at small and large
sites. Cft will be particularly useful to you if you use <a
href="http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet">Puppet</a> to manage the
configuration of your machines.
</p>

<p>
<B>How is Cft used?</B><br/> Cft is used from the command line, just before
you begin making configuration changes, and right after you finished making
them. It only requires you to issue two additonal commands, there's no need
to learn any other special tools or avoid using your favorite tool. (Well,
if that's <tt>vi</tt> there's a special restriction in the license to keep
you from using it) (I KEED, I KEED, you can use <tt>vi</tt> though it's bad
for the character)
</p>

<p>
<B>How can I contribute?</B><br/>
Send in bug reports, patches, ideas, or comments to the <A
HREF="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/et-mgmt-tools">et-mgmt-tools</A>
list.  We're interested in hearing about real-world provisioning problems
and how we can solve them for system administrators everywhere.
