Installation
============

cft is written in Ruby, so you need a reasonably recent version of ruby
installed. I use ruby-1.8.5, but older versions should be ok, too.

Prerequisites
=============

* ruby-fam and gamin/fam
  Available from
    SRPM: http://people.redhat.com/dlutter/yum/SRPMS/
    binary RPM: dig around in http://people.redhat.com/dlutter/yum/
    source: http://www.pablotron.org/software/fam-ruby/
  gamin (or fam) should be part of your distro

* ruby-rpm
  Available from
    SRPM: http://people.redhat.com/dlutter/yum/SRPMS/
    binary RPM: dig around in http://people.redhat.com/dlutter/yum/
    source: http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-rpm/

* puppet client
  Available from http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet
  Should be in most major distributions by now

There's no installation support yet for cft; to run it from a source
checkout, all you need to do is
  > export RUBYLIB=$source_checkout/lib
  > $source_checkout/bin/cft --help
