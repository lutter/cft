Installation
============

cft is written in Ruby, so you need a reasonably recent version of ruby
installed. I use ruby-1.8.5, but older versions should be ok, too.

You need ruby-fam and gamin installed; you can get ruby-fam from
  SRPM: http://people.redhat.com/dlutter/yum/SRPMS/ruby-fam-0.2.0-1.src.rpm
  binary RPM: dig around in http://people.redhat.com/dlutter/yum/
  source: http://www.pablotron.org/software/fam-ruby/

You need the puppet client installed on the machine running cft

There's no installation support yet for cft; to run it from a source
checkout, all you need to do is
  > export RUBYLIB=$source_checkout/lib
  > $source_checkout/bin/cft --help
